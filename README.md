Inspiration
Interviewing is one of the biggest bottlenecks in hiring. Companies spend countless hours conducting first-round interviews, often struggling with standardizing evaluations and reducing bias. Candidates—especially neurodivergent ones—face challenges navigating interviews due to inconsistencies in assessment criteria. Our team, many of whom have experienced these issues firsthand, wanted to build a solution that streamlines early-stage hiring while ensuring a structured, transparent, and adaptable experience for candidates.

That’s why we created ArticulAIte, a VR-enabled AI interview automation platform that allows companies to generate, deploy, and assess structured interviews using AI-powered avatars. Recruiters input a prompt, and our system automatically generates interview questions, evaluation criteria, and assessment metrics to ensure consistent and efficient hiring decisions.

What it does
ArticulAIte automates first-round interviews by enabling companies to create AI-powered interviewers that dynamically assess candidates based on customizable prompts. The platform provides:

Automated Interview Generation – Recruiters input a prompt (e.g., “Assess technical skills for a backend developer. Ask about algorithms and data structures.”), and ArticulAIte generates a structured interview with relevant questions.

Customizable Evaluation Criteria – The AI generates a list of assessment metrics based on the prompt and questions, ensuring standardized evaluations across candidates.

AI-Driven Interview Deployment – Interviews can be conducted in VR or on a web-based interface, where candidates interact with an AI avatar interviewer.

Post-Interview Analysis & Justification – ArticulAIte analyzes responses, extracts key metrics, and cites specific reasoning for each score, providing transparent, data-driven feedback.

This allows companies to efficiently scale hiring, reduce recruiter workload, and ensure objective candidate assessments while giving candidates clear insights into their interview performance.

How we built it
Building ArticulAIte required integrating AI-driven interview generation, automated evaluation, and immersive VR interactivity into a scalable hiring solution. Our system dynamically generates customized interview questions, conducts AI-powered interviews, and analyzes candidate responses to provide structured, data-driven insights for recruiters.

We leveraged OpenAI’s API and LangChain for AI-powered question generation and answer evaluation, ensuring context-aware, industry-specific interviews.

NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA Cloud (USDCode) enabled real-time AI model processing, optimizing natural language understanding (NLU) and multimodal assessments.

Hume AI was integrated for conducting technical phone interviews, allowing for nuanced analysis of speech and nonverbal cues.

We deployed a VR-based solution on Meta Quest 3, aligning with Meta’s Most Technically Complex Hack track.

Convai powered conversational AI capabilities to enhance real-time interactions with AI avatars.

Unity was used to develop immersive and interactive VR interview experiences.

Vercel was used for deploying and managing our web-based interface, ensuring scalability and performance.

By leveraging these advanced technologies, we built ArticulAIte into a comprehensive AI-driven interview automation platform that streamlines hiring efficiency, ensures structured candidate evaluations, and enhances fairness in recruitment.

Challenges we ran into
We had trouble with Omniverse generating a scene, which required additional optimization and fine-tuning. Additionally, we faced issues with APIs and extensive troubleshooting, ensuring seamless integration between various AI models and systems.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully built a scalable, fully automated interview platform that allows companies to generate, conduct, and assess AI-driven interviews in minutes. Our citation-based evaluation sets us apart, providing transparent, data-backed reasoning for each assessment. Seeing our AI conduct structured, real-time interviews and generate meaningful hiring insights was a huge validation of our work.

What we learned
This project taught us how to bridge AI-driven automation with human-centric hiring needs. We learned how to:

Fine-tune LLM-powered question generation for interview scenarios.

Optimize VR interactivity for professional settings.

Design assessment models that prioritize both efficiency and fairness.

Reimagine hiring processes to be more structured, scalable, and accessible.

What's next for ArticuAIte
We see ArticulAIte becoming an essential tool for hiring teams, with potential expansions including:

More advanced assessment models incorporating real-time behavioral analysis.

Industry-specific interview templates for specialized roles.

Candidate performance tracking over multiple interview rounds.

Seamless ATS (Applicant Tracking System) integration for streamlined hiring workflows.
